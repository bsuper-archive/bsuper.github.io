  For the past two summers, I've been driving a lot. This summer, I spend at least
  40 minutes in my car and about 2 hours on a bus to work each workday. That's a lot of
  time to kill! What I can't stand are the songs they play on the radio - 94.9,
  97.3, 99.7, 101.3, 101.7. They are repetitive and trashy, maybe except Taylor Swift,
  whom I usually enjoy listening to. As I spend more time on the road, I have realized
  that podcasts are the way to go for long commutes. Depending on your selection, they
  can be interesting, educational, and make you feel like you've learned something useful
  during the day. Here are some my recommendations, which I'll continually update over time
  as I discover more:

    <li>
        <b>Planet Money</b>
        <p>I started listening to Planet Money in high school. The podcast focuses on local and global topics, such as
            <a src="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/05/27/479717380/episode-703-how-to-hide-a-million-dollars-in-plain-sight">
     like hiding a million dollars in plain sight</a>,
            <a src="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/02/468953007/episode-687-buy-this-passport">countries selling citizenship</a>, and
            <a src="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/04/20/475023002/episode-468-kid-rock-vs-the-scalpers">ticket scalping</a>. They even <a src="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/16/470722656/episode-390-we-set-up-an-offshore-company-in-a-tax-haven">
              setup an offshore company</a> to understand how it works. Each episode is an investigation into the topic, with a several interviews with experts and ordinary people and is well narrated. I've learned a lot from just listening to these podcasts.
            Here are some of my recommendations:

	  <title>Building an Enigma Machine</title>

	     <p>During World War II, the Enigma machine was widely used by the German forces
to communicate sensitive information amongst themselves. Believed by the Germans to be
unbreakable, the Enigma had a series of rotors and a single reflector at the
end. The first rotor would map the initial input into an output letter, which
is then passed to the subsequent rotors in similar fashion. Upon reaching the
reflector, which also maps its input to an output, the translation happens in
reverse, where the output of the reflector is passed through the last rotor all
the way to the first rotor, where it is then given back as an encoded letter.
To decode, the encoded message would be passed through the Enigma machine with
the same initial state, and the original message would show up.</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bsuper/bsuper-jasper/master/assets/images/enigma/enigma1.png">

<p>Okay, I simplified it a little bit. Before every letter is processed by the
rotors, the first rotor rotates, and possibly the subsequent rotors too. Every
rotor has a notch that it rotates the next rotor on. For example, Rotor II has
notch E. This is predefined - otherwise, none of the Enigma operators would be
able to transcribe messages from their counterparts. Thus, when Rotor II is on
notch E, the next input that rotates Rotor II causes the subsequent rotor to
rotate, increasing its notch. On the other hand, reflectors don't rotate.</p>

<p>There's also the ring offset. Suppose we are abou to pass in A to a
  rotor and the rotor is at notch C. In this case, the rotor treats A as C and
  outputs the mapping for C, instead of A.</p>

<p>In addition, there's also the plugboard (<i>Steckerbrett</i>) that is used
  before the input is passed into the first rotor. Basically, the operator has
  13 wires that can change any two pairs of letters. For example, an operator
  can switch A for Z and Z for A.</p>

<p>Also, quick note about the reflector. It's mapping is reversable, so if A
  maps to D, then D maps to A.</p>
