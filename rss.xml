      <title>Building an Enigma Machine</title>
      <link>http://bsu.me//enigma</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During World War II, the Enigma machine was widely used by the German forces
to communicate sensitive information amongst themselves. Believed by the Germans to be
unbreakable, the Enigma had a series of rotors and a single reflector at the
end. The first rotor would map the initial input into an output letter, which
is then passed to the subsequent rotors in similar fashion. Upon reaching the
reflector, which also maps its input to an output, the translation happens in
reverse, where the output of the reflector is passed through the last rotor all
the way to the first rotor, where it is then given back as an encoded letter.
To decode, the encoded message would be passed through the Enigma machine with
the same initial state, and the original message would show up.&lt;/p&gt;
