      <title>Great Podcasts I Recommend</title>
      <link>http://bsu.me//podcasts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
    For the past two summers, I've been driving a lot. This summer, I spend at least 40 minutes in my car and about 2 hours on a bus to work each workday. That's a lot of time to kill! What I can't stand are the songs they play on the radio - 94.9, 97.3,
    99.7, 101.3, 101.7. They are repetitive and trashy, maybe except Taylor Swift, whom I usually enjoy listening to. As I spend more time on the road, I have realized that podcasts are the way to go for long commutes. Depending on your selection, they
    can be interesting, educational, and make you feel like you've learned something useful during the day. Here are some my recommendations, which I'll continually update over time as I discover more:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/&quot;&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I started listening to Planet Money in high school. The podcast focuses on local and global topics, such as
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/05/27/479717380/episode-703-how-to-hide-a-million-dollars-in-plain-sight&quot;&gt;
     like hiding a million dollars in plain sight&lt;/a&gt;,
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/02/468953007/episode-687-buy-this-passport&quot;&gt;countries selling citizenship&lt;/a&gt;, and
            &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/04/20/475023002/episode-468-kid-rock-vs-the-scalpers&quot;&gt;ticket scalping&lt;/a&gt;. They even &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/16/470722656/episode-390-we-set-up-an-offshore-company-in-a-tax-haven&quot;&gt;
              setup an offshore company&lt;/a&gt; to understand how it works. Each episode is an investigation into the topic, with a several interviews with experts and ordinary people and is well narrated. I've learned a lot from just listening to these podcasts.
            Here are some of my recommendations:
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/11/470136949/episode-689-a-hedge-fund-a-country-and-a-big-sailboat&quot;&gt;
                    What happens when a country, Argentina, refuses to pay its debts?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/09/469674457/episode-418-how-the-government-set-up-a-fake-bank-to-launder-drug-money&quot;&gt;
                      How the government setup a fake bank to launder drug money and uncover the drug cartel?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/01/29/464859624/episode-680-anatomy-of-a-scam&quot;&gt;
                  How does a scam work and who gets scammed?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/12/23/460689797/episode-671-an-insider-trader-tells-all&quot;&gt;
                  Getting caught insider trading.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/&quot;&gt;Startup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ever wanted to know what is it really like to have a startup? Well, you can finally do so, without the spending the long hours and many $$ needed to actually start one. In &lt;i&gt;Startup&lt;/i&gt;, the hosts follow startups through several important
            stages in their lives. Each episode involves recorded conversations between founders, partners, and even family members, who often feel a big impact when one of them is running a startup. In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/1-how-not-to-pitch-a-billionaire/&quot;&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt;,
            the show follows
            &lt;i&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/i&gt;, the company behind this show, and shows the process of starting a startup, including getting investors, communicating with the spouse, and finding a name for the startup. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/origin-story-season-2-1-2-3-4/&quot;&gt;second season&lt;/a&gt;            follows a online dating site
            &lt;i&gt;Dating Ring&lt;/i&gt; and how the startup life is like for female founders. In the current season, the show tells the stories of several startups, including &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/almost-famous-season-3-episode-1/&quot;&gt;Justin.tv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
            the predecessor to &lt;i&gt;Twitch&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/pirate-needs-pirate-season-3-episode-3/&quot;&gt;Pirate Joe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, a company that smuggles Trader Joe goods across to the Canadian border, and a food delivery company
            called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/kitchen-confidential-season-3-episode-6/&quot;&gt;Bento&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which is undergoing a possible shutdown. It's a fascinating insight into the world of startups, and I would highly recommend it if
            you ever wanted to know about startups or wanted to start one yourself.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Talking Machines&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Partially Derivative&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Serial&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Reply All&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Building an Enigma Machine</title>
      <link>http://bsu.me//enigma</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During World War II, the Enigma machine was widely used by the German forces
to communicate sensitive information amongst themselves. Believed by the Germans to be
unbreakable, the Enigma had a series of rotors and a single reflector at the
end. The first rotor would map the initial input into an output letter, which
is then passed to the subsequent rotors in similar fashion. Upon reaching the
reflector, which also maps its input to an output, the translation happens in
reverse, where the output of the reflector is passed through the last rotor all
the way to the first rotor, where it is then given back as an encoded letter.
To decode, the encoded message would be passed through the Enigma machine with
the same initial state, and the original message would show up.&lt;/p&gt;
