      <title>Great Podcasts I Recommend</title>
      <link>http://blog.bsu.me//podcasts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
    This summer, I spend at least 40 minutes in my car and about 2 hours on a bus to
    work each workday. That's a lot of time to kill! What I can't stand are the songs
    they play on the radio - 94.9, 97.3, 99.7, 101.3, 101.7. They are repetitive
    and trashy, maybe except Taylor Swift, whom I usually enjoy listening to. As
    I spend more time on the road, I have realized that podcasts are the way to go
    for long commutes. Depending on your selection, they can be interesting, educational,
    and make you feel like you've learned something useful during the day. Here are
    some my recommendations, all available on iTunes and the Podcasts app, which
    I'll continually update over time as I discover more:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/&quot;&gt;Planet Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I started listening to Planet Money in high school. The podcast focuses on
            local and global topics, such as
            &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/05/27/479717380/episode-703-how-to-hide-a-million-dollars-in-plain-sight&quot;&gt;
     like hiding a million dollars in plain sight&lt;/a&gt;,
            &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/02/468953007/episode-687-buy-this-passport&quot;&gt;countries selling citizenship&lt;/a&gt;,
            and
            &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/04/20/475023002/episode-468-kid-rock-vs-the-scalpers&quot;&gt;ticket scalping&lt;/a&gt;.
            They even &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/16/470722656/episode-390-we-set-up-an-offshore-company-in-a-tax-haven&quot;&gt;
              setup an offshore company&lt;/a&gt; to understand how it works. Each episode
            is an investigation into the topic, with a several interviews with experts
            and ordinary people and is well narrated. I've learned a lot from just
            listening to these podcasts. Here are some of my recommendations:
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/11/470136949/episode-689-a-hedge-fund-a-country-and-a-big-sailboat&quot;&gt;
                    What happens when a country, Argentina, refuses to pay its debts?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/09/469674457/episode-418-how-the-government-set-up-a-fake-bank-to-launder-drug-money&quot;&gt;
                      How the government setup a fake bank to launder drug money and uncover the drug cartel?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/01/29/464859624/episode-680-anatomy-of-a-scam&quot;&gt;
                  How does a scam work and who gets scammed?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/12/23/460689797/episode-671-an-insider-trader-tells-all&quot;&gt;
                  Getting caught insider trading.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/&quot;&gt;Startup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            Ever wanted to know what is it really like to have a startup? Well, you can finally
            do so, without the spending the long hours and many $$ needed to actually
            start one. In &lt;i&gt;Startup&lt;/i&gt;, the hosts follow startups through
            several important stages in their lives. Each episode involves recorded
            conversations between founders, partners, and even family members, who
            often feel a big impact when one of them is running a startup. In the
            &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/1-how-not-to-pitch-a-billionaire/&quot;&gt;first season&lt;/a&gt;,
            the show follows
            &lt;i&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/i&gt;, the company behind this show, and shows the process
            of starting a startup, including getting investors, communicating with
            the spouse, and finding a name for the startup. The &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot;
                href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/origin-story-season-2-1-2-3-4/&quot;&gt;second season&lt;/a&gt;            follows a online dating site
            &lt;i&gt;Dating Ring&lt;/i&gt; and how the startup life is like for female founders.
            In the current season, the show tells the stories of several startups,
            including &lt;i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/almost-famous-season-3-episode-1/&quot;&gt;Justin.tv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
            the predecessor to &lt;i&gt;Twitch&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/pirate-needs-pirate-season-3-episode-3/&quot;&gt;Pirate Joe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
            a company that smuggles Trader Joe goods across to the Canadian border,
            and a food delivery company called &lt;i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/kitchen-confidential-season-3-episode-6/&quot;&gt;Bento&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,
            which is undergoing a possible shutdown. It's a fascinating insight into
            the world of startups, and I would highly recommend it if you ever wanted
            to know about startups or wanted to start one yourself.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/&quot;&gt;Reply All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;i&gt;Reply All&lt;/i&gt; is another &lt;i&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/i&gt; podcast and focuses on
            internet related topics, such as conspiracies, online dating, and more.
            I don't listen to this podcast that often, but there is one story that
            stands outs titled &lt;i&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/28-shipped-to-timbuktu/&quot;&gt;Shipped to Timbuktu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.
            I don't want to spoil anything, but this is a must listen! I also found
            the following quite interesting:
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/27-the-fever/&quot;&gt;The perils of online dating as an asian woman.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/25-favor-atender/&quot;&gt;In Ecuador, you can talk directly to the President on social media. But doing so could be dangerous.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://gimletmedia.com/episode/ive-killed-people-and-i-have-hostages/&quot;&gt;The SWAT team vs. the internet.&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thetalkingmachines.com&quot;&gt;Talking Machines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a new podcast that I recently discovered and focuses on the theory
            and applications of machine learning. It appears to be both academic
            and practical and I'd love to check this out more.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://partiallyderivative.com&quot;&gt;Partially Derivative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I've also discovered this one recently. This one focuses on the world of
            data science.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://serialpodcast.org&quot;&gt;Serial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to listening to this podcast. Each season tells a captivating
            story from the beginning to the end. I'll let you guys know what I think
            soon! Here's season one's introduction:
            &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A high-school senior named Hae Min Lee disappeared one day after
                    school in 1999, in Baltimore County, Maryland. A month later,
                    her body was found in a city park. And two weeks after that,
                    her former boyfriend and classmate, 17-year-old Adnan Syed, was
                    arrested for the crime. He was convicted, and sentenced to life
                    in prison. Syed has always said he had nothing to do with Lee’s
                    death. Sarah Koenig sorted through thousands of documents, listened
                    to trial testimony and police interrogations, and talked to everyone
                    she could find about what happened between Adnan Syed and Hae
                    Min Lee. What she discovered is a story far more complicated
                    than the jury, or the public, ever got to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;
            And here's season two's introduction:
            &lt;blockquote&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    In May 2014, a U.S. Special Operations team in a Black Hawk helicopter landed in
                    the hills of Afghanistan. Waiting for them were more than a dozen
                    Taliban fighters and a tall American, who looked pale and out
                    of sorts: Bowe Bergdahl. Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier, had been a
                    prisoner of the Taliban for nearly five years, and now he was
                    going home.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    President Obama announced Bergdahl’s return in the Rose Garden, with the soldier's
                    parents at his side. Bergdahl's hometown of Hailey, Idaho, planned
                    a big celebration to welcome him back. But then, within days—within
                    hours of his rescue, in fact—public reaction to his return flipped.
                    People started saying Bergdahl shouldn’t be celebrated. Some
                    of the soldiers from his unit called him a deserter, a traitor.
                    They said he had deliberately walked off their small outpost
                    in eastern Afghanistan and into hostile territory.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Hailey canceled its celebration. The army launched an investigation. Finally, in
                    March, the military charged Bergdahl with two crimes, one of
                    which carries the possibility of a life sentence. Through all
                    of this, Bergdahl has been quiet. He hasn’t spoken to the press
                    or done any interviews on TV. He’s been like a ghost at the center
                    of a raucous fight.
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Now, in Season Two, we get to hear what he has to say.
                &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Asia Winter 2016. The Beginning.</title>
      <link>http://blog.bsu.me//asia1</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
    Last winter, in the span of 27 days, I traveled to Asia and visited 6 different countries,
    rode on 12 different flights, ate tons of delicious food, and made many new friends.
    Here I am, many days after the trip, reflecting upon my trip. Here’s my best
    recollection of everything that happened each day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I left San Jose International Airport near noontime onboard All Nippon Airways Flight
    171, operated by a Boeing 787–800. Nothing noteworthy happened on this flight;
    I got a middle seat on the right section of the aircraft. Fast-forward 10 hours
    later, I’m in Narita!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    After exchanging money at the airport, I headed downstairs towards the airport express
    train station. As I soon learned, Japanese people are extremely friendly towards
    others. I approached the station counter to buy a ticket towards Nippori station
    and after coughing over 2400¥ for my ticket, I headed downstairs to the platform.
    The train departed 10 minutes after I arrived and 36 minutes later, I was at
    Nippori station.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Before I had left Narita airport, I took screenshots of the path to my hotel, Hotel
    Lungwood. So, after a little difficulty placing myself on the map, I was able
    to head in the right direction. I overshot where I had to go by a block, which
    happened for several more times before I finally figured it out, I arrived at
    my hotel and checked in at around 5pm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    At around 6:30pm, I decided to leave my hotel and headed towards Shinjuku. I wanted
    to catch a glimpse of Tokyo at night at the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building
    (free) and then also buy a data sim card at Yodabashi Camera, which my hotel
    front desk recommended to go to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Walking to the Metropolitan from the subway station took about 10 minutes and after
    a quick elevator ride up to the 45th floor, I was able to indulge in the breathtaking
    views of Tokyo!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Upon leaving the Tokyo Metropolitan, I headed towards the shops near Shinjuku station.
    Initially, I found a store that had Yodobashi written in Kanji (after character
    matching, which I had to do again in Korea), but, walking inside, I saw nothing
    more than lots of console games, anime, Nitendo, etc. A store clerk, who spoke
    very little English, directed me to another store in the same district for my
    sim cards and I bought my sim cards there for about 1900¥.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    By this time, I was getting pretty hungry. Yet, at the same time, I was quite nervous
    on walking in to a restaurant and figuring out how to order. After all, what’s
    there to be afraid of?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    After walking up and down the streets looking for my first Japanese restaurant to
    dine at, I settled on a cute little ramen shop. The waiters/chef greeted me as
    a I walked and pointed towards the ticketing machine. They realized I was clueless
    as to how to use it and one of them helped me order my first ramen from the machine.
    I just picked the one that had the nicest picture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Of course, the ramen wasn’t dispensed from the machine. My friends thought I had
    bought instant ramen on my first day in Japan. After ordering and paying at the
    machine, the waiter takes the order and the chef makes it. I guess it saves the
    restaurant workers from ever touching dirty money, which I suspect isn’t really
    that dirty in Japan. After all, Japan was so clean!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The ramen cost about 900¥ and it was absolutely delicious! My stomach grumbles at
    the sight of the picture above. The noodles, the soup, the pork loin — they were
    all on point. My only gripe? They didn’t give enough, especially the meat, which
    I realized was a trend all over Japan. Granted, I was judging Japanese cuisine
    under my American culturally indoctrinated platter portion expectations. Anyways,
    following my delicious meal, I took the metro back to my hotel and got some good
    rest.
&lt;/p&gt;
