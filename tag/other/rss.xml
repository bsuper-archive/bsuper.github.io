  For the past two summers, I've been driving a lot. This summer, I spend at least
  40 minutes in my car and about 2 hours on a bus to work each workday. That's a lot of
  time to kill! What I can't stand are the songs they play on the radio - 94.9,
  97.3, 99.7, 101.3, 101.7. They are repetitive and trashy, maybe except Taylor Swift,
  whom I usually enjoy listening to. As I spend more time on the road, I have realized
  that podcasts are the way to go for long commutes. Depending on your selection, they
  can be interesting, educational, and make you feel like you've learned something useful
  during the day. Here are some my recommendations, which I'll continually update over time
  as I discover more:

        <b>Planet Money</b>
        <p>I started listening to Planet Money in high school. The podcast focuses on local and global topics, such as
            <a src="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/05/27/479717380/episode-703-how-to-hide-a-million-dollars-in-plain-sight">
     like hiding a million dollars in plain sight</a>,
            <a src="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/02/468953007/episode-687-buy-this-passport">countries selling citizenship</a>, and
            <a src="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/04/20/475023002/episode-468-kid-rock-vs-the-scalpers">ticket scalping</a>. They even <a src="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/03/16/470722656/episode-390-we-set-up-an-offshore-company-in-a-tax-haven">
              setup an offshore company</a> to understand how it works. Each episode is an investigation into the topic, with a several interviews with experts and ordinary people and is well narrated. I've learned a lot from just listening to these podcasts.
            Here are some of my recommendations:
